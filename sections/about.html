      <p class="lead">
        I’m Deva Sai Kumar Bheesetti, a Computer Science grad student with 3 years of industry experience in software engineering and 2+ years in AI, machine learning, and LLM research. I specialize in designing intelligent, scalable systems, from backend APIs to inference pipelines and AI-powered assistants.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Currently, I serve as a Graduate Assistant at the Manning School of Business, where I fine-tune transformer models, automate grading systems with Dockerized Python scripts, and lead end-to-end analytics/reporting workflows using Tableau, JavaScript, and Google Apps Script. I’ve also built a GPT-based advising bot and led data ops for flagship university events.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        My past roles at Infosys involved building robust APIs, automating business logic using Pega, mentoring teams, and integrating systems with ReactJS, SQL Server, and cloud-native pipelines. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through AI, whether it's building LLMs for healthcare or bots for community interaction.
