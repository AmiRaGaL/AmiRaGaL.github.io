        <p class="lead">
            With approximately three years of experience as a software developer, I specialize in designing
            and implementing robust backend systems and APIs, integrating frontend frameworks like React.js,
            and building efficient solutions using Pega, a Java-based tool. My background includes developing
            automation tools to streamline task execution and enhance debugging, making me highly effective at
            delivering efficient, scalable software solutions. (Test)

            Beyond development, I bring a year of leadership experience, having managed a core project module that
            required significant client interaction and cross-functional team coordination. This role sharpened my
            ability to lead complex initiatives, adapt to evolving requirements, and ensure seamless collaboration
            across diverse teams.

        <p class="lead">
            My expertise extends into AI, Machine Learning, and LLM-related projects, where I continuously seek to apply
            innovative techniques to real-world challenges. Whether developing machine learning models or fine-tuning
            large language models, I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive impactful results.
